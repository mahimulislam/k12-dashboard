STU001,Algebra,Solving Linear Equations,65,high,tutor_interaction,2025-06-20 10:05:00,"SHAP: High importance on 'factoring' and 'negative coefficients'. Model suggested a step-by-step breakdown."
STU002,Geometry,Area of Triangles,78,medium,tutor_hint,2025-06-20 10:10:00,"SHAP: Hint triggered by repeated incorrect attempts. Model identified 'multiplication' errors."
STU003,Calculus,Derivatives,92,low,student_response,2025-06-20 10:15:00,"SHAP: Positive contribution from 'correct answer'. Mastery score increased for 'derivatives'."
STU001,Algebra,Factoring Quadratics,58,high,tutor_interaction,2025-06-20 10:20:00,"SHAP: Model identified struggle with binomial factors, suggesting breakdown into simpler terms."
STU004,Statistics,Probability,71,medium,tutor_hint,2025-06-20 10:25:00,"SHAP: Hint provided due to low confidence in event space definition. Focus on sample space."
STU002,Geometry,Pythagorean Theorem,89,low,student_response,2025-06-20 10:30:00,"SHAP: Correct application of formula after prior hint. High contribution from 'triangle type'."
STU005,Algebra,Systems of Equations,63,high,tutor_interaction,2025-06-20 10:35:00,"SHAP: Difficulty with substitution method. Model emphasized isolating variables."
STU003,Calculus,Integrals,76,medium,tutor_hint,2025-06-20 10:40:00,"SHAP: Hint on power rule for integration. Model detected confusion with constant terms."
STU006,Statistics,Standard Deviation,82,low,student_response,2025-06-20 10:45:00,"SHAP: Accurate calculation, confirming understanding of data spread. Strong contribution from 'mean'."
STU004,Algebra,Quadratic Formula,69,medium,tutor_interaction,2025-06-20 10:50:00,"SHAP: Incorrect sign application in formula. Model recommended checking coefficient signs."
